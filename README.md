# dictHasher
This is a tool that takes every line off a word dictionary and hashes it and inputs it into  
a new dictionary.

TODO:  
1. ~~Add cli readopts~~
2. ~~Add more hash options~~
3. Run profiler to Optimize and multithread correctly
4. Add paired dictionary option
5. Maybe, if possible, add CUDE/GPU support
